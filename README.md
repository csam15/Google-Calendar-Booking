# Google Calendar Booking App
A web application that allows clients to book meetings directly through a calendar interface while providing admins a password-protected dashboard to manage events and availability.

This is meant as a backend implementation. You can integrate it into your app and customize the styling to match your design.
## Features (v1)

### Client Booking Page
- Fill out a form with name, email, phone number, meeting type, and message
- Select a meeting date and time based on availability
- Only shows times allowed by the admin and connected Google Calendar

### Admin Dashboard
- Password-protected access
- View all upcoming events for a selected week
- Cancel or reschedule events
- Block out unavailable times, including:
  - **All-day events** (vacations, holidays)
  - **Timed events** (lunch breaks, appointments), with repeat options

# Installation and Execution

### 1. Fork this repo

### 2. Set up environment variables
Populate the `env.txt` file with the required keys and tokens.  
ðŸ‘‰ Follow [Google Cloudâ€™s getting started guide](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/get-started) for setup details.  

### 3. Generate Google tokens
Start your dev environment and visit:  http://localhost:3000/api/auth/google-setup
Youâ€™ll be prompted to sign in with your Google account. After signing in, youâ€™ll receive your `GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN` and `GOOGLE_ACCESS_TOKEN`.  

### 4. Add admin credentials
Set your **admin username** and **password** in the same `env.txt` file.  

### 5. Finalize environment file
Rename `env.txt` to `.env.local`.  
This ensures it will be ignored by GitHub and that values can be accessed via `process.env`.
